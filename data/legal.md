## Payment Policy

### Online Payment by Bank Card

Our website is connected to an internet acquiring system, and you can pay for services using Visa or Mastercard directly on the site.  
After confirming your order, a secure payment window from **Robokassa** will open, where you will need to enter your bank card details and email address to receive a receipt.

We use the **3D Secure** protocol for payment confirmation. If your bank supports this protocol, you will be redirected to your bank’s server to enter a one-time code sent via SMS.

### Payment Details

You will be required to enter the following on the payment page:

- Card number  
- Expiry date  
- CVV2 / CVC2 (three digits on the back of the card)  
- Email address

**3D Secure** helps verify that the payment is being made by the actual cardholder and reduces the risk of fraud.

If the 3D Secure code does not arrive, please contact your bank.
